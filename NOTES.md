# Ansible Notes
Ansible is an automation engine that allows for agentless system configuration and deployment over SSH.

## Debugging
If you use the Terraform lab, here are some important notes on debugging:
- If something in the user data doesn't install at boot time, check these logs: `sudo cat /var/log/cloud-init.log`

## Housekeeping
- Once you have Ansible installed, if you need to, you can modify the /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg file: `vim /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`
- You can see the default values for everything there
- By default, the inventory file used is /etc/ansible/hosts
- You can modify this with `sudo vim /etc/ansible/hosts`
- Go to the bottom, add the IP address of the target hosts, like so:
```
[nodes]
10.1.2.138
10.1.2.24
```
- You could also give the host an "alias" to make it easier to manage, like this: `node1 ansible_host=10.1.2.138`
- You will also need to create the `ansible` user on all instances: `sudo useradd ansible`
- You can verify the `ansible` user was created with `getent passwd`
- **NOTE**: The `ansible` user should be created by default at runtime if you're using the Terraform lab environment.
- SSH to the **managed node(s)**
- On the **managed node(s)**, create a password for the `ansible` user with `sudo passwd ansible`
- The reason we set up the password is because we will have to log in with it in order to create a pre-shared key
- We don't need a password on the control node because we  will be logging into it with SSH
- **NOTE**: If you are using the Terraform lab environment, on the **managed node(s)** you must first edit the SSH config. `sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config`, change `PasswordAuthentication` to `Yes`, `sudo systemctl restart sshd`
- Go back to the **Control Node**
- Switch to the `ansible` user with `sudo su - ansible`
- Now run the SSH keygen `ssh-keygen`. Just hit Enter and accept defaults for purpose of the lab. 
- You need to copy the public key to the **managed node(s)** in order for pre-shared key authentication to work.
- You can do this easily with `ssh-copy-id 10.1.2.138`
- Here is where it will prompt you for the password you set earlier. Type **yes** and enter the password
- It will tell you it has successfully been added, and recommend you try logging on remotely. It will display the syntax to do so
- On the **managed node(s)**, run `sudo visudo`. This brings you to the sudoers file. It is where you can allow users to execute commands as root.
- Under `## Same thing without a password` block, type `ansible ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL`. The block should now look like this:
```
## Same thing without a password
# %wheel        ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
ansible         ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
```
- Now any command ran by the `ansible` user will be ran as root.

## Ansible Docs
- It is important to know where to look for information from within Ansible docs. You need to know where to find good documentation, quickly.
- The best place to start, is https://docs.ansible.com
- The most important place is the Module Index: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/index_module.html
- You can also use the `ansible-doc` command at the command line. 
- Let's imagine you want to review documentation for the **ansible.builtin.apt** module. Use:
`ansible-doc -s apt`

## Ansible Modes
### Ansible Ad-hoc
- Comparable to **bash commands**
- Example: Create a user
- One-off things that you do not expect to repeat
- Useful when you're learning a module and you don't know how it works
- Ad-hoc commands are ran using the `ansible` command. Example: 
`ansible nodes -m setup | less`
- **NOTE**: The `setup` module gathers information about the hosts specified. It is very verbose, so the `less` command helps us to see a little at a time.
- More information on the `setup` module can be found here: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/setup_module.html 
- Another example of an ad-hoc command is to test the reachability of a remote node:
`ansible nodes -m ping`
- Let's say you wanted to install Apache Web Server. Try:
`ansible nodes -m yum -a "name=httpd state=latest"`
- If you try the above command, you will get an error message telling you that you need to run the command as a superuser. For that, we'll add the `-b` flag (more information on the `--become` or `-b` flag can be found at https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/become.html). So the command will be:
`ansible nodes -b -m yum -a "name=httpd state=latest"`
- The above command will only install Apache though. Let's make sure we start the httpd service (like `systemctl start httpd`, but the Ansible way!):
`ansible nodes -b -m service -a "name=httpd state=started"`
- You can verify that **httpd** is running by going to the **managed node(s)** and running `sudo systemctl status httpd`. You should see something like:
```
‚óè httpd.service - The Apache HTTP Server
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/httpd.service; disabled; vendor preset: disabled)
   Active: **active (running)** since Sat 2022-02-12 21:06:09 UTC; 2min 10s ago ...
```
- If you were to run the `ansible nodes -b -m service -a "name=httpd state=started"` command again, you'll see basically the same image you saw before, only this time the text will be **green** as opposed to **orange**. 
- It will also have `"changed": false` toward the top. This is because Ansible understands the concept of **state**
- Plays, or specific ad-hoc commands, can be ran against the same target over and over again, with no consequence or whether or not it will create issues. An exception to this would be shell commands, which could escape that **idempotent** concept that we want to focus in on.

### Ansible Playbook
- Comparable to **bash scripts**
